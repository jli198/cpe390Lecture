        I once wrote this as a demo for high school thinking I would
        find out the real autofocus algorithm later.
        Turns out, it is the one that everyone uses:
        estimate focus by summing the absolute value of the difference
        between every pixel to right, left, up and down. The higher the
        number, the "sharper" the picture is.
        However, this algorithm has a bug. Find it!
