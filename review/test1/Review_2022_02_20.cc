/*
        Review of C++ we have covered
1. legacy types ( int, char, long int, long, short int, short, long long)
  You should know that:
     char = 1 atomic memory unit, which these days means 1 byte
     char s = 'x'; // character constants use single quotes
     char a[] = "this is a string"; // strings are arrays of letters, with the
last letter '\0' The character '\0' is called NUL in ASCII. This is different
than a NULL pointer short <= int <= long but sizes are not standard, and this is
not portable signed/unsigned of int is NOT STANDARD which is horrible. int on
our computers is 32 bits (4 bytes) and signed Constants and what their types
are: 123 (int) -123 (int) 123U (unsigned int) 123ULL (unsigned long long) 1.23
double (NOT FLOAT) 1.234f float 'x' char

                          The sizeof operator reports how many bytes a type or
variable is. For example cout << sizeof(int); should print 4

2. new C++11 portable types
   unsigned: uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64_t
   signed: int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, int64_t

2b. integer errors (overflow, underflow)

2c. Type promotion. Computers only work in single data type.
For example, you can add floating point numbers, or integers, but you cannot
mix. If we combine two different tpyes, one that is less capable is "promoted"

For example:
  double x = 3 + 4.2; // 3 is converted to 3.0
  double y = 3 / 2; // first compute integer 3 / 2 which is 1, THEN convert
to 1.0 uint32_t z= -1; // convert bits of -1 (11111111111111111111111111) to
unsigned 32-bit

3. floating point types (IEEE754 standard)
   float, double
   nonstandard (and we don't use it) long double

   next gen standard IEEE754-2008 (not in hardware yet) quad precision.
   available in gnu as __float128
   also incidentally __int128 is in hardware (x86 only)

3b. floating point errors: roundoff errors, numbers not exactly representable
   associativity does not hold: a + b + c != a + (b+c)

   The terms sign bit, exponent, and mantissa
    Some numbers we think as "nice" like 1/10 are not finite in binary because
    1/5 is repeating fraction

    Equality is useless with floating point numbers. Testing a == b or a != b is
    almost always not going to work. Instead we use approximations and tolerances, for example:

    if (abs(b-a) < .0000001) {
      cout << "close enough";
    }

4. calling functions, passing parameters

5. recursive functions
   a function that calls itself and has a terminating condition.
   Know how to write factorial recursively and iteratively

Example problems:
  Write recursive implementation of factorial that can compute up to factorial(100) without overflow

6. object oriented programming we have just touched on, so it is not
   on the test.

7.
        You should know the following sources of bugs:
        uninitialized variables
        overflow
        roundoff error
  bounds checking
For each bug, identify the reason the program isn't working and if it can be
fixed, fix it.
