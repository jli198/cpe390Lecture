T = 1/f each clock period = 1/1.5 billionth of second 2/3ns

how far does light travel in 1ns? 1ft
latency
  1. shrink computer (bring close together)
  2. send asycnhronously (don't wait)
having master clock to synchronize is faster

2Gb - 8Gb

4Gb = 2 **32
every address on machine = 32 bits

64-bit operating system, every address = 64 bits

0x000000007FFF2414

why 64-bit
AARCH64 has ARM A72

1. division --> call function
2. hardware acceleration for encryption
3. other speiiality instructions
4. Anyone with Mac using M1 chip can program on that
5. NEON vector engine  2 double multiply-add
