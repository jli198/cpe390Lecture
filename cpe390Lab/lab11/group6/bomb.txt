phase1:
9737 (look at the comments on the right)

phase2:
4638 (first hex #) Type it into terminal.
4638 + x = 302 <- (second hex #). solve for x:  x = -4336

phase3:
type in a random phrase. keep pressing ni. 
@ ~<phase3+52> type in these commands:
x/s $x0
x/s $x1
it'll be a sentence (array of chars). Restart and put the sentence in. I got:
Wednesday has been cancelled due to a scheduling error.

phase4:
x!/((x-2)!2!) = 26241390 (find # after it being lsl)
Plug into symbolab
x = 7245
