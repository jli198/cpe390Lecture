==================================================================
inline was inputted when suggested by the comments in the program:
==================================================================

==========================================
Horner's Form/original line commented out:
==========================================

===================================================================================
r/r in line 71 of original becomes (r*r) as multiplication is faster than division:
===================================================================================

==============================================================================
operation amag/r replace with new variable amag which equals original amag/r:
==============================================================================

==================================================================================
sin and cos of theta were separate calculations. each had one variable
it's = to sin(theta) and cos(theta) -> renamed variables to sintheta and costheta:
================================================================================== 

bodiesbyName[orbits] = &bodies.back(); commented out but change was negligible
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
theta is 0 so costheta would be 1 and sintheta would be 0
costheta * variable = 1 * variable = variable
sintheta * variable = 0 * variable = 0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
replaced the trig functions with above equivalencies but change was negligble
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
amagr redundant as it can be divided by r*r*r (r^3) in before line
dont have to divide by r*r (r squared) in the next line but this was negligble
============================================================================================
vec3d.cc functions pasted into vec3d.hh file ->
vec3d.hh functions pasted into gravsim.hh (at top). classes Body and GravSim were intact ->
deleted #include "Vec3d.hh" mentions in Gravsim.hh file ->
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
opened 'makefile' and deleted every sight of vec3d.o (including one where it had children :O)
ran make in the terminal and this popped out:
