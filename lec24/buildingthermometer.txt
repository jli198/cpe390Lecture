1. Build voltage divider
  V mid = (V1+V2) / (V1*V2)
  
  Vcc = 5V
  A0 = Vcc(Rres/ (Rphoto+Rres))
  example: photoresistor dark = 5500ohm, "light" = 500ohm
2. Figure out known "ground truth" 
need existing thermometer
what about temperature measure not being same place as thermometer are building?
  a. Insulate test container
  b. Use material that has high heat capacity
  c. Use known temperature material ice bath
  d. water has SALT in it
  e. voltage changes, sensor probably isnt same
  f. observer principle: by measuring something, change it
  g. voltage of power supply will affect A/D converter
  h. changes over time? UGH!

3. What is different kind of sensor that would heat water less? Thermocouple
