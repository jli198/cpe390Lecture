What have learned this Semester?
How to program efficiently (poratbly?) in C++
How it works under hood (ARM Assembler)
How to use knowledge of computer to program more efficiently
* Some instructions are fastest than others
* Some operations can be eliminated if they are redundant
* Block I/O can be optimized by understanding nature of developer

Where Can Go from Here?
Kruger not teaching 390 any more
Learn C++ (CPE-553, but warning, first few weeks should already know)
Data Strucutres (CPE-360, CPE-593) How to make more efficient programs by choosing better ways to solve problems
Computer Architecture (CPE-517) How to design microprocessor
Digital Design (CPE487)
GPU Programming (??) Zeng Fang, Hong Liu

Last Day! Reach Topics
How are computers developing today?
How fast can current hardware get?
Are there any new technologies that can continue to improve performance?

Clock Speed is Unlikely to Improve in Current Technology
Fundamental limits are heat (power density)

How to Improve Computation/Watt?
Parallel computation (multithreading)
Mutiple execution units
Vectorization (will look at vectorization now)

New technologies
Optical Computing
* Requires photonic logic (does not exist yet)
* Reduced heat, therefore increased speed 
* Reduced crosstalk, potentially increasing density
TeraHertz Circuits

Quantum computers
For certain kinds of computation, quantum computers are much faster
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing
Example: Breaking RSA (Schorr's algorithm)
const int n = 1 << 30;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  if (test(i)) {

  }
}
on quantum computer bits = qqqqqqqqqqqqqq
Find solution such taht test(qqqqqqqqqqqqqq)

pick p,q prime size of p, q = 4096 bits / 64 = 80 words
password="cat" BAD
10000000000000000000000000000000000097 Prime? EHUGH
#2 is not prime 
#3 divide by 3 trikzies
n=pq = O(8k bits)

125125125
x12512515
=========

asymmetric crypto
anyone can send message with PUBLIC key
but only can decrypt message
factor(n) {
  for (i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++) {
    if n % i == 0
  }
}

Thank you for your Hard Work this Semester!
Final Topics
1. C++ and assembler covered on Test #1 and #2
2. hardware
  a. CPU - central processing unit. brain of computer. executes instructions
  b. ALU - arithmetic logic unit. digital combinational logic circuit performs bitwise and arithmetic operations on integer binary
  c. How multiple cores make computers faster (parallel processing)
    i. allows more instructions to be executed simultaneously
  d. Limiting factors of multiple cores (shared memory, limited bandwidth)
  e. How RAM is faster sequentially (row, burst mode, multiple banks)
    i. seek operation allows disk head to read memory quicker in pattern rather than randomly
  f. Cache - stores small amount of data in block of memory which allows future requests of data to be serviced quicker
    i. relies upon locality of reference which assumes that blocks of memory will be used again
    ii. smaller and faster as it can look up memory locations recently processed by processor
    iii. close to CPU and RAM which means more of it leads to faster retrieval to CPU. holds recently processed instructions that can be yoinked faster
    iv. slower RAM technology makes cache better option for retreiving heavily processed instructions
  g. How to make Block I/O more efficient (read integer number of blocks at time)
  ^^^ Code 4 bytes at time Disk Block Size 4K not great. have buffer. Need to be even multiple of block size
3. A/D conversion
  a. resolution: (Vref-Vground)/2**n 
  b. quantization error: +-(Vhigh-Vlow)/2(2**n) OR 1/2*resolution
  c. tradeoffs (cost, power, speed, #bits)
    i. slower ADC and less bits makes ADC errors comparable.
4. Motor control
  a. PWM (how do make motor run at 50% power?)
    i. duty cycle 50% of usual duty cycle of 100% (half power)
  b. H-bridge (how to make motor go forwards and backwards?)
    i. 4 MOSFETS (of either or all N or P-channel)
    ii. diagonal transistors powered on. drain goes to positive and negative. drain to each port
  c. N-channel and P-channel MOSFETS: basically use N-channel, more efficient; also basically the negative of each other
    i. Gate, Source, Drain
      a. Gate: controls flow of electric current through circuit
      b. Source: where voltage comes from
      c. Drain: where voltage is grounded
      d. VDS (Drain to source) voltage
    ii. Draw schematic controlling motor
    iii. Explain what gate voltage has to be to turn motor on for N or P channel
      a. N-channel: + OR 0V; electrons
      b. P-channel: - gate voltage; holes
