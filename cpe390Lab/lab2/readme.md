# Lab_2: C++ practices I

**Instructions:**
In this lab, you will write code in cooperation with a partner. Each of you should do half the problems, and if there is a difficulty mentioned, you should each do one of the harder ones. It is perfectly ok for both of you to work together on all problems but both need to understand what you did. You are both responsible to learn how to do basic integer loops and logic as well as arrays. (Your group will be assigned by your TAs) <br>

We may not have covered every feature used in this lab in class by the time you get it. You should be capable of reviewing how if statements work, and doing some basic floating-point calculations. Feel free to ask your TA for help. <br>

**Submission Requirements:  You have to complete the code of each function and pass the test cases in the main.cpp we provide on the Github repo. You can not change the input/return data type of each function. You only have to finish the code inside the functions. <br> 
Note: You need to put your name and your teammateâ€™s name in the comment part. Also, if you take some code from the website, you need to give a citation of it. Also the pledge part.** <br>

**Integer Problems** <br>
| gcd(a,b) | return greatest common divisor of a and b. For example, gcd(12,18) = 6, gcd(15,13) = 1 Tem = 13 15/13->13-->15/12->12--...|
|---|---|---|
| isPrime(a) | return true if positive integer a is prime, false otherwise. Hint: if want to check A is prime or not, need to check A mod i equals to 0 or not, where i is from 2 to A - 1. For example: to determine whether 5 is prime: 5%2 != 0, 5%3 != 0, 5%4 != 0, 5 is prime. To determine whether 4 is prime: 4%2 == 0, 4 is not prime|
