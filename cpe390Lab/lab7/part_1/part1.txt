a. What is the instruction to compute 64-bit unsigned multiplication?
  Show an example where X0 = X1 * X2
// your answer here: The instruction is umull.
  umull	x0, x1, x2

b. What is the instruction to compute 64 bit signed multiplication?
  Show an example where X0 = X1 * X2
// your answer here: The instruction is mull
  mull	x0, x1, x2

c. What is the instruction to compute 32-bit unsigned multiplication?
  Show an example where W0 = W1 * W2
// your answer here: The instruction is umul
  umul x0,x1,x2

d. What is the instruction to compute 32-bit signed multiplication?
  Show an example where W0 = W1 * W2
// your answer here: The instruction is mul
  mul x0, x1, x2

e. What is the instruction to compute double-precision floating-point addition?
  Show an example where d0 = d1 + d2
// your answer here: The instruction is fadd
  fadd	d0, d1, d2

f. What is the instruction to compute double-precision floating-point multiplication?
  Show an example where d0 = d1 * d2
// your answer here: The instruction is fmul
  fmul d0, d1, d2

g. What is the instruction to compute double-precision floating-point fused multiply-add?
  Show an example where 
// your answer here: The instruction is fmadd
  fmadd	d0, d0, d0, d1

The code in C++ can be more complicated than what we learned in class.
From class, review the instructions that load from memory into a register, and store a register back into memory.

h. What is the instruction to read from memory at the location in the X0 register, and load it into X1
// your answer here: ldr x1, [x0]

i. What is the instruction to write X1 into memory at location X0
// your answer here: str x1, [x0]

j. If you write a 64-bit quantity into memory and want to move to the next location, how much must you add to the index register? Write the instruction
// your answer here: add x0,8

k. If you write a 32-bit quantity into memory and want to move to the next location, how much must you add to the index register? Write the instruction
	// your answer here: add x0,4
